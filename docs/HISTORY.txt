Changelog
=========

1.2 (2013-09-10)
----------------

- Improve reindexing object security performance.
  We now walk down the children and stop walking down if the security indexes
  of an object have not changed.
  [jone]

- Added support for atomic updates.
  This means whenever possible, only the necessary / specified attributes get updated
  in Solr, and more importantly, re-indexed by Plone's indexers.
  IMPORTANT: This requires the Solr instance to have an <updateLog/> configured in
  solrconfig.xml and the schema needs to contain a _version_ field.
  See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/Atomic_Updates for details.
  [lgraf]

- Make sure values in search patterns are all lowercase.
  [buchi]


1.1.2 (2013-07-18)
------------------

- Sort facet fields in the order specified in the Solr control panel.
  [buchi]

- Fixed handling of path filter which was always removed when respect_navroot
  is set to False.
  [buchi]

- Handle invalid facet parameters.
  [buchi]

- Monkey patch reindexObjectSecurity for both CatalogAware and CatalogMultiplex
  so the relevant security indexes in solr also get updated.
  [lgraf]

- Only add the default search argument to the query if it's not None and if
  Solr has a default search field defined in it's schema (which is deprecated
  in Solr). This mainly prevents logging of 'dropping unknown search attribute'
  warnings.
  [buchi]

- Escape forward slashes in all query values, not only in paths.
  [buchi]

- Always insert the default 'select' search handler into the query parameters if
  no 'qt' parameter is provided. We need this because we have to disable the
  /select search handler in the Solr configuration to be able to select other search
  handlers by parameter.
  [buchi]


1.1.1 (2013-06-01)
------------------

- Also use livesearch request handler in livesearch when grouping is disabled.
  [buchi]

- Fixed "show more" link in live search to point to @@search view.
  [buchi]


1.1 (2013-05-31)
----------------

- Reorganized monkey patches.
  Everything patch-related now lives in the patches subpackage.
  [lgraf]

- Make sure @@search view doesn't fail when called without parameters.
  [lgraf]

- Only display selected facets list if there actually are selected facets.
  [lgraf]

- Added spellchecking feature (aka "Did you mean ...").
  [buchi]

- Made respecting the navroot for searches configurable.
  Only if `ISearchSettings.respect_navroot` is set searches will be constrained
  to the navigation root (defaults to False).
  [lgraf]

- Added autocomplete support based on Solr's suggester component.
  [buchi]


1.0.2 (2013-05-28)
------------------

- Fixed querytarget of livesearch for Plone 4.2 and later.
  Use our @@livesearch_reply view instead of livesearch_reply.
  [buchi]

- Include description in snippetText.
  [buchi]

- If there's a SearchableText indexer, use it for snippetText generation.
  [buchi]

- Make length of breadcrumbs shown in search results configurable.
  [buchi]

  breadcrumbs_view for each item.
  [buchi]

- Added support for dexterity content types in snippetText indexer.
  [buchi]


1.0.1 (2013-05-21)
------------------

- Monkey patching c.solr.search.Search.buildQuery in order to escape slahes in paths.
  [lgraf]
