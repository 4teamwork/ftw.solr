------------------

- Scan for external links after every search page refresh.
  [mathias.leimgruber]

- Do not use TALES string expressions for facet links, since it automatically transforms

  getRemoteUrl attribute that starts with 'http' are handled as external

  byte strings to be consistent with catalog brains.
  [buchi]


1.3 (2013-12-19)
----------------

- Updated jquery.history.js to latest version (1.8.0b2) which fixes issues
  with URI encoding in IE9.
  [buchi]

- Removed link to advanced search in livesearch when no results are found.
  [buchi]

- "show all"-link includes the path attribute.
  [elioschmutz]

  value_lwc and value_twc that have leading respectively trailing wildcards appended
  to each of the search terms.
  [lgraf]

  [buchi]

  [Julian Infanger]


1.2.1 (2013-09-10)
------------------

- Fixed monkey patch of mangleQuery.
  [buchi]


1.2 (2013-09-10)
----------------

- Improve reindexing object security performance.
  We now walk down the children and stop walking down if the security indexes
  of an object have not changed.
  [jone]

- Added support for atomic updates.
  This means whenever possible, only the necessary / specified attributes get updated
  in Solr, and more importantly, re-indexed by Plone's indexers.
  IMPORTANT: This requires the Solr instance to have an <updateLog/> configured in
  solrconfig.xml and the schema needs to contain a _version_ field.
  See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/Atomic_Updates for details.
  [lgraf]

- Make sure values in search patterns are all lowercase.
  [buchi]


1.1.2 (2013-07-18)
------------------

- Sort facet fields in the order specified in the Solr control panel.
  [buchi]

- Fixed handling of path filter which was always removed when respect_navroot
  is set to False.
  [buchi]

- Handle invalid facet parameters.
  [buchi]

- Monkey patch reindexObjectSecurity for both CatalogAware and CatalogMultiplex
  so the relevant security indexes in solr also get updated.
  [lgraf]

- Only add the default search argument to the query if it's not None and if
  Solr has a default search field defined in it's schema (which is deprecated
  in Solr). This mainly prevents logging of 'dropping unknown search attribute'
  warnings.
  [buchi]

- Escape forward slashes in all query values, not only in paths.
  [buchi]

- Always insert the default 'select' search handler into the query parameters if
  no 'qt' parameter is provided. We need this because we have to disable the
  /select search handler in the Solr configuration to be able to select other search
  handlers by parameter.
  [buchi]


1.1.1 (2013-06-01)
------------------

- Also use livesearch request handler in livesearch when grouping is disabled.
  [buchi]

- Fixed "show more" link in live search to point to @@search view.
  [buchi]

  [lgraf]

- Only display selected facets list if there actually are selected facets.
  [lgraf]

  [buchi]

- Made respecting the navroot for searches configurable.
  Only if `ISearchSettings.respect_navroot` is set searches will be constrained
  to the navigation root (defaults to False).
  [lgraf]

- Added autocomplete support based on Solr's suggester component.
  [buchi]


1.0.2 (2013-05-28)
------------------

- Fixed querytarget of livesearch for Plone 4.2 and later.
  Use our @@livesearch_reply view instead of livesearch_reply.
  [buchi]

- Include description in snippetText.
  [buchi]

- If there's a SearchableText indexer, use it for snippetText generation.
  [buchi]

- Make length of breadcrumbs shown in search results configurable.
  [buchi]

- Added option to generate breadcrumbs from path rather than calling
  breadcrumbs_view for each item.
  [buchi]

- Added support for dexterity content types in snippetText indexer.
  [buchi]


1.0.1 (2013-05-21)
------------------

- Monkey patching c.solr.search.Search.buildQuery in order to escape slahes in paths.
  [lgraf]

- Overwrite search extender: Add write permissions, fixed translations and
  allowed content types in textfield.
  [Julian Infanger]
